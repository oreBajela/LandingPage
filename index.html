									<p>I am a data science student with a minor in economics at Case Western Reserve University. Growing up in Nigeria, where access to technology and educational resources can be limited, profoundly shaped my perspective and fueled my passion for technology and empowering women in tech. These early experiences motivated me to pursue a career where I could leverage data and technology to create meaningful impact.

										My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming, statistical analysis, and data modeling. Courses such as statistical theory with application, linear algebra, and data structures have been particularly impactful in shaping my analytical and problem-solving skills.
										
										In addition to my academic and professional experiences, I have actively participated in projects that merge my interests in technology and social good. For instance, during a hackathon called Data for Good, my team worked on determining the optimal expansion location for a nonprofit supporting Black and brown youth in underprivileged neighborhoods.
										
										I am also passionate about empowering women in technology, which drives my involvement in initiatives like Girls Who Code and The Womenâ€™s Network. I believe fostering diversity in tech is crucial for innovation and problem-solving, and I am dedicated to contributing to this cause.
										
										Looking ahead, I aspire to leverage my skills in data science and economics to drive strategic business decisions and create positive social impact. I am particularly excited about the intersection of technology and finance.</p>
